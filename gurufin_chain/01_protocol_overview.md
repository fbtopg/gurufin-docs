# Protocol Overview

Gurufin Chain is a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain designed to serve as a global on-chain FX (foreign exchange) and DeFi hub for the Web3 economy. Unlike general-purpose blockchains, Gurufin Chain is specifically optimized for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and cross-border payments.

## Core Design Philosophy

Gurufin Chain addresses three fundamental challenges that have hindered blockchain adoption in traditional finance:

| Challenge | Gurufin's Solution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Unpredictable Fees** | Guru-PEG mechanism provides fiat-indexed, stable transaction costs |
| **Cross-Chain Fragmentation** | IBC-first architecture with EVM compatibility bridges multiple ecosystems |
| **Regulatory Uncertainty** | Built-in compliance modules support KYC/AML and FATF Travel Rule requirements |

---

## Key Capabilities

**High Performance**
- Sub-second block finality
- Up to 10,000 transactions per second
- Deterministic transaction confirmation (no probabilistic waiting)

**Interoperability**
- Native Cosmos IBC support for cross-chain communication
- EVM Gateway for Ethereum ecosystem compatibility
- GatewayGX module for non-IBC chains (Solana, etc.)

**Financial Infrastructure**
- Hybrid execution model combining AMM and RFQ for optimal pricing
- Payment-versus-Payment (PvP) atomic settlement
- Sovereign stablecoin support with transparent reserves

---

## Technology Stack

Gurufin Chain is built on the **Cosmos SDK** framework, leveraging:

- **Tendermint BFT Consensus**: Provides Byzantine fault tolerance and instant finality
- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**: Balances decentralization with performance
- **Modular Architecture**: Enables independent upgrades and feature additions

---

## Target Use Cases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Cross-Border Payments | Real-time, low-cost international transfers using stablecoins |
| FX Trading | Institutional and retail currency exchange with minimal slippage |
| Stablecoin Issuance | Sovereign-grade stablecoins with transparent reserve backing |
| DeFi Applications | Compliant lending, borrowing, and yield generation |

## What Makes Gurufin Different

Gurufin Chain is not just another blockchain—it's a **neutral settlement layer** designed specifically for financial applications. By combining predictable fees, regulatory compliance, and multi-chain connectivity, Gurufin enables both institutions and retail users to participate in Web3 finance with confidence.
