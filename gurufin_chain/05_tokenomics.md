# Tokenomics ($GXN)

The GXN token is the native utility token of the Gurufin ecosystem, serving as the fundamental economic layer that powers the Gurufin Chain and GX Stablecoin networks. GXN enables four core functions: staking for network security through the Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, governance participation for protocol decision-making and parameter adjustments, fee payments for all on-chain transactions using the Guru-PEG fiat-indexed model, and liquidity provisioning within the hybrid AMM/RFQ trading infrastructure.

The tokenomics model is carefully designed to align incentives among validators, liquidity providers, governance participants, and end-users, fostering a robust ecosystem where each stakeholder benefits from network growth and stability.

**Token Utility**

* **Staking** — Delegate GXN to validators to secure the network and earn rewards
* **Governance** — Vote on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and treasury allocation
* **Fee Payment** — Pay transaction fees with predictable, fiat-indexed costs
* **Liquidity** — Provide liquidity to FX trading pools and earn swap fees

**Supply & Allocation**

The maximum supply at genesis is 100 billion GXN. Key allocations include a Node Pool (25%) for validator staking rewards and emissions, an Ecosystem Development fund (20%) for builders, grants, and public goods, with the remainder distributed across team, strategic partners, and community programs with multi-year vesting schedules.

**Economic Sustainability**

A portion of all collected GXN fees is permanently burned to the Gurufin Abyss Ledger (GAL), a keyless on-chain burn address. This creates deflationary pressure as network usage grows. Validators earn rewards from both emissions and an increasing share of fee revenue, while liquidity providers earn swap fees with optional governance-approved incentive top-ups during bootstrap phases.
