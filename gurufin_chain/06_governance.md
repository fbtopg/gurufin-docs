# Governance

Gurufin Chain employs a robust **on-chain governance framework** that enables decentralized decision-making through the collective participation of validators and token holders. The governance system leverages the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, where **validators** are elected by token holders to represent the network in consensus and voting, while **delegators** participate indirectly by delegating their stake to trusted validators and sharing in both rewards and responsibilities. The proposal lifecycle follows a structured process—from submission with deposit requirements, through a voting period where participants can vote Yes, No, Abstain, or No with Veto, to automatic execution upon approval—ensuring all protocol changes are transparently recorded and enacted on-chain.
