# Governance

Gurufin Chain employs a robust on-chain governance framework that enables decentralized decision-making through the collective participation of validators and token holders. The governance system leverages the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, where validators are elected by token holders to represent the network in consensus and voting, while delegators participate indirectly by delegating their stake to trusted validators and sharing in both rewards and responsibilities.

The proposal lifecycle follows a structured process—from submission with deposit requirements, through a voting period where participants can vote Yes, No, Abstain, or No with Veto, to automatic execution upon approval—ensuring all protocol changes are transparently recorded and enacted on-chain.
