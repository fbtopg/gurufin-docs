# Welcome to Gurufin

Gurufin is a global on-chain FX/DeFi hub for the Web3 economy, designed to provide a secure, efficient, and compliant infrastructure for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and cross-border payments. The ecosystem is built upon two core pillars: the **Gurufin Chain**, a public DPoS Layer-1 blockchain, and the **GX Stablecoin network**, a system of jurisdiction-specific, sovereign stablecoin chains.

Our vision is to create a neutral settlement layer that unifies global digital finance, enabling seamless and low-cost value transfer across borders. By combining a high-performance blockchain with a network of regulated stablecoins, Gurufin offers a unique platform for developers, financial institutions, and users to build and access the next generation of financial services.
