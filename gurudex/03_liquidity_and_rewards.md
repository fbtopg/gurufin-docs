# Liquidity & Rewards

Liquidity providers deposit stablecoins into GuruDex pools and receive LP tokens representing their proportional share of the pool. GuruDex uses a **Virtual-Pair mechanism** where LPs provide liquidity to two single-coin pools simultaneously and manage their stake through one unified Virtual LP token, simplifying multi-currency liquidity provision. Swap fees accumulate continuously—0.3%+ dynamic fees from retail trades and ~0.1% fixed fees from institutional trades—and are distributed to LP token holders in 24-hour cycles via the FeeDistributor contract. To ensure regulatory compliance and revenue fairness, institutional LP returns are capped at 7% annually, with excess rewards redistributed to retail LPs, resulting in higher expected returns for retail participants. This incentive structure encourages broad liquidity participation while maintaining a sustainable and compliant reward distribution model.
