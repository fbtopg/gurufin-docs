# Risk Mitigation

GuruDex implements a 4-layer defense strategy to protect against FX volatility and market manipulation. **Layer 1 (Reserve Fund)** maintains 5–10% of pool liquidity as an insurance fund to compensate losses from rapid rate fluctuations, with automatic replenishment from trading fees. **Layer 2 (Dynamic Fees)** adjusts retail fees in real-time based on pool utilization and volatility, suppressing speculative trading during stress (fees can scale from 0.3% to 0.63% in crisis conditions). **Layer 3 (Limits & Validation)** caps individual swaps at 5% of pool liquidity and enforces oracle triple validation—time freshness (<5 min), price deviation (<1%), and confidence threshold (>95%)—to block stale or manipulated price data. **Layer 4 (Circuit Breaker)** automatically halts trading when critical thresholds are breached (e.g., >5% price swing, >20% liquidity drain, suspicious transaction patterns), securing time for operator response and preventing cascading losses.
