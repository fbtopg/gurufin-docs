# DEX Overview

GuruDex is an FX-specialized decentralized exchange designed for seamless swaps between sovereign stablecoins (USGX, KRGX, JPGX, PHGX, etc.) on Gurufin Chain. Unlike general-purpose DEXs, GuruDex consolidates institutional and retail liquidity into unified hybrid pools, enabling deep liquidity with minimal slippage for both small retail trades and large institutional FX settlements. The platform employs a dual-algorithm execution model—an AMM for retail users with dynamic fees and oracle-based pricing for institutions with fixed low fees—ensuring optimal execution for all user types. Core smart contracts (FXSwapMaster, HybridStablePool, PriceOracle, InstitutionalRegistry) work together to provide regulatory-grade controls, real-time price validation, and compliance integration, positioning GuruDex as an on-chain equivalent to traditional FX infrastructure like CLS.
