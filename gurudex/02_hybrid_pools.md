# Hybrid Pools

GuruDex employs a hybrid pool architecture that combines two distinct pricing mechanisms within a single liquidity pool per stablecoin. The **retail segment** uses a Uniswap-style constant product AMM (x × y = k) with dynamic fees that increase as the pool becomes imbalanced, incentivizing arbitrageurs to restore equilibrium. The **institutional segment** uses oracle-based real-time FX rates with fixed low fees (~0.1%), enabling large trades at precise market prices without significant slippage. Both segments share the same underlying liquidity reserves, maximizing capital efficiency while maintaining internal accounting separation for privacy and compliance. This single-pool-per-coin design reduces operational complexity by ~66% compared to traditional pair-pool approaches (n pools instead of n×(n-1)/2), and allows new currencies to be added with just one pool deployment.
