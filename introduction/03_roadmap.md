# Roadmap

Gurufin follows a milestone-driven development approach with security-first principles. Every component undergoes rigorous auditing before mainnet deployment, and major protocol changes go through governance proposals and community feedback.

**Phase 1 (Foundation)** has been completed, establishing the core infrastructure: Gurufin Chain mainnet launch with Tendermint BFT consensus, GXN token deployment with staking, CosmWasm smart contract integration, and basic on-chain governance. **Phase 2 (Expansion)** is currently in progress, focusing on deploying GuruDex with hybrid AMM + RFQ execution, launching the first GX Stablecoin sovereign chains, implementing IBC connectivity, and rolling out the Guru-PEG fiat-predictable fee mechanism along with EVM Gateway compatibility.

Looking ahead, **Phase 3 (Scale)** will expand the GX Stablecoin network to additional jurisdictions, introduce enhanced PvP settlement with multi-leg support, and deliver institutional API suites for FIX protocol integration. **Phase 4 (Global)** represents our long-term vision: CBDC bridge integration, partnerships with traditional financial market infrastructures, and transition to a fully community-governed protocol serving 100M+ users worldwide.
