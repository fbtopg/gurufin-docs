# Core Principles

The Gurufin ecosystem is guided by a set of core principles that inform our design, architecture, and development. These principles ensure that we are building a platform that is not only technologically advanced but also aligned with the needs of the global financial landscape.

## Our Guiding Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Purpose-Built for FX & Cross-Border Payments** | Gurufin is not a general-purpose blockchain. It is specifically designed to be a highly efficient and scalable platform for foreign exchange and cross-border payments, addressing the unique challenges of this domain. |
| **Market-Neutral & Interoperable** | We believe in a multi-chain future. Gurufin is designed to be a neutral hub that connects to various blockchain ecosystems through IBC and other interoperability solutions, fostering a collaborative and interconnected digital economy. |
| **Compliance-First Design** | In the world of finance, compliance is not optional. We have embedded regulatory compliance into the core of our architecture, from the jurisdictional PoA model of GX Stablecoins to the optional compliance hooks in the Gurufin Chain. |
| **Developer-Friendly & Open** | While offering institutional-grade features, the Gurufin ecosystem is open to all developers. We provide familiar tools like EVM compatibility and comprehensive documentation to empower developers to build innovative applications. |
| **User-Centric Experience** | We are committed to providing a seamless and predictable user experience. Features like **Guru-PEG** for stable fees and gas abstraction for paying fees in various tokens are designed to make our platform accessible and easy to use for everyone. |
| **Transparency & Security** | We prioritize the security and transparency of our platform. From the 24/7 live proof-of-reserves for GX Stablecoins to the open-source nature of our codebase, we are committed to building trust with our users and community. |
