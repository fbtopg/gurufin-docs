# Vision & Mission

Gurufin was founded to solve the fundamental inefficiencies in global finance. Despite rapid technological advancement, moving money across borders remains slow, expensive, and inaccessible to billions. International transfers take 2-5 days to settle, cost 6-7% in fees, and require extensive banking infrastructure that excludes emerging markets from participating in the global economy.

Our vision is a world where value moves as freely and instantly as information. We are building the **Stablecoin FX Layer**—a unified global settlement infrastructure where transactions settle in seconds, fees are near-zero and predictable, and anyone with internet access can participate. By combining high-performance blockchain technology with a network of regulated, fiat-backed stablecoins, Gurufin creates the bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized economy.

Our mission is to become the definitive infrastructure layer for stablecoin-based foreign exchange and cross-border payments, enabling developers, institutions, and users worldwide to build and access the next generation of financial services.
