# What is Gurufin?

Gurufin is the **Stablecoin FX Layer**—a purpose-built blockchain infrastructure designed specifically for foreign exchange and cross-border payments using stablecoins. Rather than being a general-purpose blockchain, Gurufin is specialized financial infrastructure that combines the efficiency of blockchain technology with the stability and regulatory compliance required for institutional adoption.

The ecosystem is built on two interconnected pillars. The **Gurufin Chain** is a public, permissionless Layer-1 blockchain built on Cosmos SDK with Tendermint BFT consensus, offering sub-second finality and up to 10,000 TPS. It serves as the neutral settlement layer where FX trading, DeFi applications, and cross-chain transactions occur. The **GX Stablecoin Network** is a federation of sovereign stablecoin chains, each operating under its own jurisdiction with licensed validators. These stablecoins are fully backed 1:1 by fiat reserves and feature automated minting/burning through bank API integration.

Together, these components create a complete system: GX Stablecoins are minted when users deposit fiat through licensed partners, flow to Gurufin Chain via IBC for trading and DeFi activities, and can be redeemed back to fiat at any time. This architecture delivers the speed and programmability of blockchain with the regulatory compliance and stability that global finance demands.
