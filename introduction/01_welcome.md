# Welcome to Gurufin

Gurufin is a global on-chain FX/DeFi hub for the Web3 economy, designed to provide a secure, efficient, and compliant infrastructure for stablecoins, tokenized assets, and cross-border payments. The ecosystem is built upon two core pillars: the **Gurufin Chain**, a public DPoS Layer-1 blockchain, and the **GX Stablecoin network**, a system of jurisdiction-specific, sovereign stablecoin chains.

Our vision is to create a neutral settlement layer that unifies global digital finance, enabling seamless and low-cost value transfer across borders. By combining a high-performance blockchain with a network of regulated stablecoins, Gurufin offers a unique platform for developers, financial institutions, and users to build and access the next generation of financial services.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Gurufin Chain** | A public, permissionless DPoS Layer-1 blockchain that serves as the neutral settlement layer for the ecosystem. It features a hybrid execution model, fiat-predictable fees, and robust interoperability. |
| **GX Stablecoins** | A network of sovereign stablecoin chains, each operating under its own jurisdiction with licensed validators. These stablecoins are fully backed by fiat reserves and feature automated, bank-API-anchored minting and burning. |

This documentation will guide you through the architecture, features, and development tools of the Gurufin ecosystem.
