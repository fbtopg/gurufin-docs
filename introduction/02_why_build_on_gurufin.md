## Key Advantages

| Feature | Description |

| **Embedded Compliance** | The **GX Stablecoin network** is built with compliance at its core. By using a jurisdictional PoA model with licensed validators, we provide a regulatory-compliant environment for financial services. |
| **High Performance & Scalability** | The Gurufin Chain, built on Tendermint BFT, offers sub-second finality and a throughput of up to 10,000 TPS, ensuring that your applications can scale to meet global demand. |
| **Seamless Interoperability** | With an **IBC-first architecture** and an **EVM Gateway**, Gurufin offers seamless connectivity to the broader blockchain ecosystem, allowing you to connect your applications to a wide range of assets and users. |
| **Atomic Cross-Chain Settlement** | Our **Payment-versus-Payment (PvP)** settlement mechanism enables risk-free, atomic swaps of assets across different blockchains, eliminating the need for trusted intermediaries. |
